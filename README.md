# ðŸ§  Comparative Analysis of Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, YOLOv11

This project presents a comparative study on brain tumor detection using multiple versions of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm â€” YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11. The goal is to evaluate performance across versions in terms of detection accuracy, speed, and robustness using medical imaging datasets.

## ðŸ§ª Project Objective

To analyze and compare the performance of different YOLO models on brain MRI scans for detecting and localizing brain tumors effectively.
