# 🧠 Comparative Analysis of Brain Tumor Detection using YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, YOLOv11

This project presents a comparative study on brain tumor detection using multiple versions of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm — YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11. The goal is to evaluate performance across versions in terms of detection accuracy, speed, and robustness using medical imaging datasets.

## 🧪 Project Objective

To analyze and compare the performance of different YOLO models on brain MRI scans for detecting and localizing brain tumors effectively.

## 📊 Results & Comparison
All trained model weights and results are stored in the Model results/ directory. Each YOLO version has its own folder containing metrics, loss curves, confusion matrices, and sample detections.

### DataSet : Brain tumor MRI Image

### 📌 Dependencies
Python 3.8+
PyTorch
OpenCV
Ultralytics
TensorBoard
Git LFS

##📝 Future Scope
Integration with segmentation models (e.g., U-Net)

Tumor classification (benign vs malignant)

Real-time MRI analysis

Clinical report generation using NLP
