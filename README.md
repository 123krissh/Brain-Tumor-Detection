# 🧠 Comparative Analysis of Brain Tumor Detection Using YOLO Variants and CNN

This project conducts a comparative study of brain tumor detection using multiple versions of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm — including YOLOv3, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, YOLOv11 — alongside a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The primary aim is to evaluate and compare these models in terms of detection accuracy, inference speed, and robustness on brain MRI image datasets.

## 🧪 Project Objective

To systematically analyze and compare the performance of different YOLO models and a CNN-based approach for effective detection and localization of brain tumors in MRI scans.

## 📊 Results & Comparison
All YOLO trained model weights and evaluation results are available in the Model Results/ directory. Each YOLO variant has its own folder with metric reports, loss curves, confusion matrices, and sample detection outputs.

The CNN model and its evaluation results are available in the CNN Results.zip file, which contains training and validation accuracy tables along with corresponding graphs.
